## Project objective:
Build a collaborative music storytelling platform where users input emotional text to co-create a unique "Emotional Symphony" — with real-time generation of matching music and animations.

## Project Stakeholders:
* Self-care groups: Users who seek light-hearted, engaging experiences that enhance comfortable emotional expression with others.
* Social users: Individuals who enjoy sharing their creations and receiving feedback. They aim to express and share emotions through media.

## Deliverables & Roadmap
* Turn-based emotional text input by multiple users
* Automated generation of music and animations to form a complete story
* Visual interface and real-time animation feedback (e.g., forests, ocean waves, neon lights)


### Expected Outcome
* Users will collaborate via a web interface to input emotional text. The system will automatically generate a complete video featuring synchronized music and animations. Each piece becomes a unique, emotionally expressive “Emotional Symphony” that users can replay, download, or share on social platforms.
