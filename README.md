## Project objective:
Build a collaborative music storytelling platform where users input emotional text to co-create a unique "Emotional Symphony" — with real-time generation of matching music and animations.

## Project Stakeholders:
* Self-care groups: Users who seek light-hearted, engaging experiences that enhance comfortable emotional expression with others.
* Social users: Individuals who enjoy sharing their creations and receiving feedback. They aim to express and share emotions through media.

## Deliverables & Roadmap
* Turn-based emotional text input by multiple users
* Automated generation of music and animations to form a complete story
* Visual interface and real-time animation feedback (e.g., forests, ocean waves, neon lights)

## Special constraints
* The platform will comply with major data privacy regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). No personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected or stored.
* All emotional text inputs will be processed anonymously and used only to generate real-time multimedia content. Users will retain the right to request data deletion and understand how their input is used.

### Expected Outcome
* Users will collaborate via a web interface to input emotional text. The system will automatically generate a complete video featuring synchronized music and animations. Each piece becomes a unique, emotionally expressive “Emotional Symphony” that users can replay, download, or share on social platforms.
